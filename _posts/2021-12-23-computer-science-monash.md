## Introduction

Hey üòÉ How is it going? If you ended up on this *extremely simple* blog post, I can only be assuming that your are interested in finding out more on the CS course at Monash University. This blog post is catered towards new and prospective students (if you are already in Monash, what I'm gonna say is not novel to you).

A little introduction about me; I'm Juay, and studied CS at **Monash University Malaysia**  from October 2018 to November 2021. Half of my studies were face-to-face, and the other half was online. Me after online studies:

Thankfully as of end of 2021, I have gotten news that campus will be re-opening in 2022! ü§© Well at least some people are excited about it.

In this blog post, I will outline a few things about this CS course in hopes to give you, my beloved reader, a clearer understanding of what this uni offers. Of course, a huge and obvious disclaimer, this is all my opinion and you may feel free to disagree if you wish to üòÇ. I would describe myself as an average student, so my views and opinions will definitely be shaped by my personal experiences.

# Course details

In this section, I will explain a little bit of the details of the academics that I have went through. To be safe, you should get an updated description of the course using the [monash handbook][monash-handbook] since this topic is subject to changes. However, I will paint a broad picture just so that you can get a rough idea about it.


I would break down the subjects that you study into three parts: 
1. **Core units**

    As the name suggest, these units or subjects have to be completed by everyone taking this course. As a result, they are quite broad and general which aims to cover the more primary aspects of CS.

    Example units that I took includes mathematics, computer systems (i.e. hardware), algorithms and data structures, introduction to computer science, and computer science theory. 

    If you are not sure of what these means, in layman terms, I took two math units (don't worry its pretty manageable if you have done any form of math before), a unit which covers all the functioning parts of the physical computer, and many units which covers computer science concepts. 

    *Tip: This is where you get to meet most if not all of your CS mates from your intake. Take this opportunity to connect with them :)*

2. **Specialization units**

    There are two specializations that were offered during my time, namely Advance Computer Science and Data Science. These specializations require you to take up additional compulsory units from their track, and a list of approved units. 

    I would say that the difference is that Advance Computer Science is more programming heavy, and gets closer towards software engineering/development. Data Science focuses on... Data Science üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I have done all the units from both specializations so I can say that its not really that important in the sense that even if you have chosen a specialization, you still can study the other as electives (like me!) or in your own free time outside of uni.

    However, it is my personal and humblest opinion that Advance Computer Science specialization is arguably a better choice **if** you are not really into Data Science or unsure about it. The added *hard* programming skills that you pick up in the former is quite useful.

3. **Elective units**

    Elective units give you free rein to studying whateverrrr you want to study. Yes, that includes picking up other subjects from other schools that tickle your fancy. Its especially useful if you want to study something else but your tiger parents forbids it.

    *Tip: You can actually complete another major/minor from another school if you are interested. Although I only know a few people who take this opportunity to learn something new, and many people just take units within the School of IT. It's up to you to decide.*

**Summary**
This course really puts more emphasis on software or computer science concepts. If you are interested on the hardware/electrical side of things, its not for you. Also, its not an IT course. It does get theoretical at times, and does not focus on a certain technology or programming language, but mainly because it just touches the key aspects or ideas and allow students to pick up the specifics. 

I also have created a **poorly edited** [video of me rating CS units][video-rating]. These will give you a better idea of CS units and my views of them. Please go easy on me, its the first time I edited a video üòì.

# Academics

For most CS subjects, they usually have lectures, tutorials/labs. Terminology might differ between units, but all of them have a class dedicated towards the theoretical concept and other classes focusing on practical/coding questions. Usually the theoretical lectures are recorded (so you can review them later) but the practical classes may not (depending on what is the situation like). I honestly skip attending the live lectures just to watch at 2x speed but some people like to ask questions while it is happening.  

At Monash, the material is taught as a flipped-classroom kinda thing. Which means that you would have to do some pre-class activity first (such as readings), before you attend the classes. 

&nbsp;

For each subject/unit, the timeline is:
- 12 weeks of classes.
    - In each week, a new concept/theory/application will be introduced. 
    - You will also have assignments to hand in. Sometimes every week too :((

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
    *Tip: Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed by the material during the semester. You might not have the time to go through every conceivable concept. Time will be given in the next week for you to clarify anything before heading to exams. However, from my opinion, do ensure that you complete as many assignments as possible.*

- SWOTVAC
    - According to google, it means: "Study Without Teaching Vacation".
    - Before Monash, I have never heard of this term before. But its simply one week of "break" that you get in order to recap the entire sem worth of material before the exam.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
    *Tip: This is period where your lecturer differentiate the men from the boys and the women from the girls. Your marks from in-semester assessments might be good, but exams usually covers a non-trivial weightage. Sometimes 40% to 60%. Create a study plan and stick to it. I usually cover all the lectures,tutorials,labs (basically all the materials) and sample exam questions if provided. This period tests your time management skills as you prepare for the exams on your own.*

- Exam
    - Exam period covers maybe a month or so. Your exams may be placed somewhere within the exam period, and if you are lucky, your paper might be closer towards the end. That gives you even more time to prepare for your subject. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
    *Tip: Not much tip that I can give here. However, some questions/topics are more favoured by the teaching team. It all boils down to what are the learning outcomes that they want to emphasize. Visit each unit guide at the [monash handbook][monash-handbook] for details. If there is a very complex/mathematical concept for a non-math unit and you are not sure if it will come out, if its not covered in the learning outcomes, chances are its not going to appear in the exam. Take this with a grain of salt however üôÉ*

**Summary**
Academics are important, but they are not the only goals. Something that I thing that I would change is probably my attitude of the academics. Though my results are pretty decent, an obsessive compulsion of getting all the HD's (High Distinctions) achievable is not a very good and healthy mindset. 

My best advice is to set a realistic target for yourself based on what is achievable, and not to fret over each assignment. You win some, you lose some and best strategy is to focus on things that will benefit you in the long run (especially ADS: Algorithms and Data Structures if you are aiming to work at a big company and OOD: Object Oriented Design for more software developer role), and/or the bigger assignments/tests that demonstrate more marketable skills (such as those that appear in job listings).

# Extra-curriculars

Ahhh... this is the part where many CS students fear. Have you ever heard of the stereotype that CS students know many languages? Yeah programming language and not human ones lol. This is the starter pack you need:

![CS Starter Pack](CS-Starter-Pack.png "Starter Pack")

To counter that, many CS students, including me, have thought that we have to have these few things to flesh out our CV:
- Leadership roles in clubs/societies outside of academics. 
- Projects. 
- Work experience and internships.

After finishing my degree, here is what I found out. Out of the three, work experience is definitely the most important. If you are in Malaysia, this is also compulsory to graduate for STEM courses. The uni provides some assistance in this regard, so unless you are completely undesirable XD, you should be able to get some experience. 

In terms of leadership roles, we have student association called MUSA (Monash University Student Association) which is pretty divisive (some people really don't like MUSA while some are really into it).
There are also other clubs and societies at Monash which you can join.

From my experience, I do think its useful to put on your resume as it shows that you have done something besides just studying. However, based on the job interviews that I have, most interviewers do not really point it out, or care too much to ask. It may affect them when they first look at your resume, but if you want to talk about it, you have to bring it up.

So, in my view, join a club only if you are interested in their events they organize, and get your hands dirty by helping them to organize events. But only do so if you are interested and motivated, and not just to fill up your resume. Its a waste of time if you solely just want to add it to your CV only.

In terms of projects, I do find that interviewers are not extremely picky. Sometimes they can ask projects that you have done in uni, or on your own free time. Again, I presume its to find out about your own interests and your ability to work in a group. I would approach it the same way with clubs and societies.

# Random Tips
1. Group work is really important. Pleeaasee ensure you participate in your team project. Not only will your team members appreciate it, but it also give you stuff to talk about during your hiring interviews. If you maintain good relations with your peers, they may be able to help you even after you graduate.

2. [SETU][setu](Student Evaluation of Teaching and Units) is a resource that you can use when picking units. Though if I am not mistaken, they are only accessible once you are in uni. There are other forms of reviews of units as well, though this one has been there for some time. Do check peer reviews for units that you want to take as electives.


## End

Thank you for reading this post. School of IT also have a Discord server where people discuss unit related stuff, seeking help, job offers, etc. Do look out for the invitation when you join the course. There may be many other things that I have not covered. If you have any enquiries, please feel free to contact me at my twitter account.üòÉ
